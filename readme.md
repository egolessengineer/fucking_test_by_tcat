## A Poem for Tcat

In the corner, Tcat sprawls,  
A smoking oaf who never calls,  
With lazy eyes and a hefty yawn,  
A good-for-nothing, from dusk till dawn.  

He lounges high on cushions soft,  
Dreaming dreams of the aloft,  
While mice and mischief pass him by,  
Tcat just sighs, and lets them fly.  

Oh, Tcat dear, what shall we do?  
With your endless naps and your nonchalant view,  
Yet in your charm, we find delight,  
Our smoking oaf, our heart's invite.  

## About Tcat

Tcat is more than just a name;  
A character wild, yet never to blame.  
In this world of hustle and race,  
Tcat reminds us to slow our pace.

This poem is free to share,

Enjoy the charm of this feline friend,  
In every heart, let his spirit blend.
